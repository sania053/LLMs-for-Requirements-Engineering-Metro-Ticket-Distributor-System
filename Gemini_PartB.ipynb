            "Given the complexity and the variety of stakeholders involved in the Metro Ticket Distributor project, several elicitation techniques are suitable. Here's a breakdown:\n",
            "\n",
            "**1. Interviews:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Why:** Interviews are crucial for understanding the specific needs and pain points of different stakeholder groups.  They allow for in-depth exploration of perspectives, especially from key stakeholders like Metro Management, the Finance Department, and end-user groups (daily commuters, tourists, passengers with disabilities, etc.).\n",
            "* **How:** Structured interviews with prepared questions can be conducted with representatives from each stakeholder group.  Open-ended questions should be used to encourage detailed responses and uncover hidden requirements.  For example, interviewing daily commuters about their current frustrations with ticket purchasing can reveal valuable insights.  Similarly, interviewing passengers with disabilities can help ensure accessibility requirements are thoroughly addressed.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Workshops:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Why:** Workshops bring key stakeholders together to collaboratively discuss requirements and reach a consensus. This is particularly useful for complex systems like the ticket distributor, where different departments have varying priorities.\n",
            "* **How:**  A facilitated workshop with representatives from Metro Management, Finance, IT, Marketing, and Operations can be held to define high-level requirements and identify potential conflicts or dependencies.  A workshop specifically focused on accessibility with disability advocacy groups can ensure the system meets the needs of all users.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Document Analysis:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Why:** Analyzing existing documentation, such as reports on current ticket sales, customer service complaints, and maintenance logs, can provide valuable background information and identify areas for improvement.\n",
            "* **How:** Reviewing existing data on ticket sales can inform decisions about ticket types and pricing strategies.  Analyzing customer complaints can highlight usability issues with the current system.  Maintenance logs can reveal potential hardware reliability concerns.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Use Cases:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Why:** Use cases provide a detailed description of how different users will interact with the system.  This helps to clarify system functionality and identify potential usability issues.\n",
            "* **How:** Develop use cases for different scenarios, such as purchasing a single-trip ticket, using a smartcard, or handling a failed transaction.  Each use case should outline the steps involved, the actors involved, and the expected outcome.  For example, a use case for a tourist purchasing a multi-day pass could highlight the need for multi-lingual support.\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Prototyping:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Why:** Prototypes allow users to interact with a simulated version of the system early in the development process. This helps to gather feedback on usability and identify potential design flaws before significant development effort is invested.\n",
            "* **How:** Develop low-fidelity prototypes (e.g., paper prototypes or wireframes) to test key user interface elements and workflows.  Gather feedback from representative users and iterate on the design based on their input.  This is particularly important for ensuring the system is accessible to users with disabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. Observations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Why:** Observing users interacting with the current ticket purchasing system can provide valuable insights into their behavior and identify pain points that may not be apparent through other elicitation techniques.\n",
            "* **How:** Conduct observational studies at different times of day and on different days of the week to understand user behavior during peak and off-peak hours.  Pay attention to how users interact with ticket vending machines, ticket counters, and fare gates.  This can help inform the design of the new system.\n"
