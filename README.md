# GenAI for Requirements Engineering â€“ Metro Ticket Distributor System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project applies **Generative AI** to automate and enhance **Requirements Engineering** for a metro ticket distributor system.  
Using **multiple LLMs** (LLaMA 3.2, Mistral, Gemini, Deepseek) integrated via **Ollama** and APIs, we designed a pipeline to:
- Gather requirements from stakeholders
- Generate user stories adhering to the **INVEST framework**
- Prioritize requirements using the **MoSCoW method**
- Resolve conflicts between functional and non-functional requirements
- Evaluate model outputs using the **RUST Questionnaire**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Automate user story generation using multiple LLMs.
2. Compare outputs from different LLMs for **readability, understandability, specificity, and technical accuracy**.
3. Demonstrate how AI can assist in **elicitation techniques** and **requirements prioritization**.
4. Identify model limitations in **acceptance criteria** and **stakeholder analysis**.
